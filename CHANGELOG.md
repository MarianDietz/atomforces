## 0.4.0 - Small changes
* The Atomforces view now shows an indicator that tells you whether the last API call was successful. This makes it easier to check whether the API is down or if there are other problems with Codeforces at the moment.
* Shows a message when something has been submitted.
* Compilation view now closes automatically when there is no output.

## 0.3.0 - Bugfix
* Codeforces often responds with an error when too many requests are made. This version increases the API cooldown from 250ms to 1s.

## 0.2.0 - Sibling contests added
* Sibling Contests: When there are two or more contests taking place at the exact same time (for example a contest split into Div.1 and Div.2), all problem sets are combined. This gives you the opportunity to solve Div.1 problems when actually working on Div.2 problems and vice versa.
* Node dependencies updated
* Programming language list updated

## 0.1.1 - First Release
* Most important features added
